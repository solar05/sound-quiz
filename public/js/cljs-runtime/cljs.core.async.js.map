Input sources can be added to\n  the mix with 'admix', and removed with 'unmix'. A mix supports\n  soloing, muting and pausing multiple inputs atomically using\n  'toggle', and can solo using either muting or pausing as determined\n  by 'solo-mode'.\n\n  Each channel can have zero or more boolean modes set via 'toggle':\n\n  :solo - when true, only this (ond other soloed) channel(s) will appear\n          in the mix output channel. :mute and :pause states of soloed\n          channels are ignored.
